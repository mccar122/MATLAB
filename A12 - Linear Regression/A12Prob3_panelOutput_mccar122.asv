%% ____________________
%% INITIALIZATION

%imports and prepares data to be analzyed
data = readtable("Data_panelX5_output_measurements.csv");
Peak_Sun_Hours_Table = data(:,1);
Peak_Sun_Hours = table2array(Peak_Sun_Hours_Table);
Panel_Output_Table = data(:,2);
Panel_Output = table2array(Panel_Output_Table);
Peak_Hour = input("Peak Sun Hours: ");

%% ____________________
%% REGRESSION CALCULATIONS

%The following code calculates regression statistics helpful in studying
%the model of the data provided
Coefficients = polyfit(Peak_Sun_Hours, Panel_Output, 1);
Panel_Output_Mean = (sum(Panel_Output)) / numel(Panel_Output);
Panel_Output_PV = Coefficients(1) * Peak_Sun_Hours + Coefficients(2);
SSE = sum((Panel_Output - Panel_Output_PV).^2);
SST = sum((Panel_Output - Panel_Output_Mean).^2);
R_Squared = 1 - (SSE/SST);


%% ____________________
%% REGRESSION TEXT & FIGURE DISPLAYS

%This code prints regression stats and plots a graph with both data and
%model line
fprintf("Model SSE: %.2f Model SST: %.2f Model R^2: %.2f", SSE, SST, R_Squared)
plot(Peak_Sun_Hours, Panel_Ouput, "k", Peak_Sun_Hours, Panel_Output_PV, "b")

ylabel("Power Ouput")
legend("Data", "Model")
%% ____________________
%% PREDICTION CALCULATIONS AND DISPLAY

%calculates and prints user input estimated power output
Panel_Model_Ouput = Coefficients(1) * Peak_Hour + Coefficients(2);
fprintf("The predicted electrical output is %.2f kWh", Panel_Model_Output)
